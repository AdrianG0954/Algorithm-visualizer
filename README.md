# Algorithm-visualizer
This project is one to help visualize sorting algorithms. I am using pygame, which is a module that lets one create games using python.
I am using pygame because I am experienced with python and wanted to see how one could create something visualy appealing using this language.
This is done for the moment, but as time continues I strive to add more and new features to this project.
